My training is in Public Policy (M.A. UAI, 2011), Economics (M.Sc. Caltech, 2015), and Biostatistics (Ph.D. USC, 2020).\nI obtained my Ph.D. in Biostatistics under the supervision of Prof. Paul Marjoram and Prof. Kayla de la Haye, with my dissertation titled “Essays on Bioinformatics and Social Network Analysis: Statistical and Computational Methods for Complex Systems.”\nI’m available for coding, data science, network science, and data visualization consulting."
