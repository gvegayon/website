# Software

I am deeply committed to **open-source software** and have been building professional-grade tools for over 15 yearsâ€”going back to the days of [Google Codehere](https://code.google.com/archive/p/rdspl/){target="_blank"}. My work combines rigorous statistical methods with modern software engineering practices, including **version control** (Git/GitHub), **continuous integration**, **agentic AI**, **container technologies**, and **agile methodologies**. I have led scientific software development teams to deliver **high-performance**, **reliable**, and **user-friendly tools** that are widely adopted by researchers and practitioners. Most of my work is built in C++ with wrappers for R and Python, optimized for use in high-performance computing environments. Across all projects, I design with performance and usability in mind, ensuring that complex methods can be both scalable and accessible.

The following is an exhaustive list of the software packages I have either built or contributed. You can take a look at my most recent contributions and ongoing open source projects on [my GitHub](https://github.com/gvegayon)
