# Software

I am deeply committed to **open-source software** and have been building professional-grade tools for over 15 years—going back to the days of [Google Code here](https://code.google.com/archive/p/rdspl/){target="_blank"}. My work combines rigorous statistical methods with modern software engineering practices, including **version control** (Git/GitHub), **continuous integration**, **agentic AI**, **container technologies**, and **agile methodologies**. I have led scientific software development teams to deliver **high-performance**, **reliable**, and **user-friendly tools** that are widely adopted by researchers and practitioners. Most of my work is built in C++ with wrappers for R and Python, optimized for use in high-performance computing environments. Across all projects, I design with performance and usability in mind, ensuring that complex methods can be both scalable and accessible.

A couple of projects to highlight include:


```{r}
#| label: cards
#| results: asis
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
x <- yaml::read_yaml("software_highlights.yaml")
for (n in names(x)) {

  cat('::: {.columns style="display: flex;"}\n')
  with(x[[n]], {
    cat('::: {.column style="width: 20%; display: flex; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center"}\n')
    cat('![](', img, ')\n')
    cat(':::\n')
    cat('::: {.column style="width: 80%; vertical-align: middle; display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; margin: 40px"}\n')
    cat(description)

    # Now, pasting a GitHub icon with a link to the repository
    cat(
      sprintf(
        '[![](%s){width="20px"}](%s)\n',
        "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Octicons-mark-github.svg",
        github
        )
    )
    cat(':::\n')
  })
  cat(':::\n\n')
}
```

The following is an exhaustive list of the software packages I have either built or contributed. You can take a look at my most recent contributions and ongoing open source projects on [my GitHub](https://github.com/gvegayon)

```{r}

tmp <- tempfile(fileext = ".bib")
file_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gvegayon/resume/refs/heads/master/software.bib"

ans <- download.file(
  url = file_url,
  destfile = tmp
)

stopifnot(ans == 0)

ans <- file.copy(from = tmp, to = "software.bib")
