*Note: This page will automatically fetch and display the latest software from my resume repository when the R packages are available in the build environment.*

## Development Philosophy

I believe in developing software that is:

- **Open Source**: All my packages are freely available under permissive licenses
- **Well Documented**: Comprehensive documentation with examples and tutorials  
- **Tested**: Rigorous testing to ensure reliability
- **Performant**: Optimized for speed, especially for large-scale computations
- **User-Friendly**: Intuitive APIs that follow R conventions

## Contributions

I actively contribute to the R ecosystem and have contributed to various open-source projects. My packages are available on:

- [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) (The Comprehensive R Archive Network)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/gvegayon) (Development versions and additional tools)
