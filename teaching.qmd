# Teaching

I am a dedicated educator who enjoys sharing knowledge and fostering an open and inclusive learning environment. Most of my teaching experience has been in the areas of data science, statistics, and network science. Committed to open science, I ensure all my educational contents are freely available online.

### Applied Network Science With R
![](img/cover-book-sna.png){width="50%"}

The book is a collection of presentations, workshops, and tutorials I have developed over the years to teach network science with R. The book mostly deals with ERGM models and network data processing. The book was written entirely in quarto, which makes it completely reproducible.
