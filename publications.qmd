## Key Software Contributions

Many of my publications are accompanied by open-source software implementations. You can find these in the [Software](software.qmd) section or on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/gvegayon).

## Collaboration

I'm always interested in collaborative research opportunities. If you're working on problems related to network analysis, statistical computing, or complex systems, feel free to [reach out](mailto:g.vegayon@gmail.com).
