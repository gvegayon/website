# Research

I am a methodologist working at the intersection of complex systems and statistical computing, with a focus on **high-performance computing** and **machine learning**. A central part of my work is the development of scientific software: as a **professional software engineer**, I dedicate significant effort to ensuring that the methods and tools I create are reliable, open, and widely accessible to the research community. My collaborations span diverse fields, including **epidemiology**, **public health**, **social network analysis**, and **genomics**, but they all share a common foundation in heavy computation and advanced statistical methods.
